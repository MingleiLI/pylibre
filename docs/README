communications with Async I/O support, a complete SIP Stack and other
protocols like DNS, SDP, RTP/RTCP, STUN, TURN, ICE.


The goal of this project is to build a complete set of Python Bindings
for libre, with user and communitity driven input for API design. An important
goal is to make the highlevel API very user-friendly and simple to use.

    $ python setup.py build
